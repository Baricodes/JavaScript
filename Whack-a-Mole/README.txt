How it works:

Again I will be breif because the app.js file is well commented.
I placed a static grid in the index.html file and used a forEach
function and the classList.add/remove functions to move the 'mole'
around the grid. The randomSquare function is the main part of this
project.

What I learned:

How to use the forEach() function and the setInterval function.
