How it works:

I placed an empty div element in the index.html and within
the app.js I use an object array and the map() function to populate
empty div element. 

What I learned:

I learned about basic relations between HTML 
and JavaScript. Pratical use of the map()
function the innerHTML property and 
document.querySelector().
