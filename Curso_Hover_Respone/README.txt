How it works:

Using an event listener the div element listens for the presence
of the mouse hovering over it and add a certain class .hover
in from the styles.css file in repsonse. The oppisite happens
when the absence of the mouse if detected through and event 
listener, i.e the .hover class is removed.

What I learned:

Using arrow functions, eventListeners. 
Adding and removing classes from HTML 
elements.
